Extra programs I try to compile in termux 

This repository contains programs that I try to compile in termux, 
they're all compiled for ARM32, you don't need to compile them, 
Just enter the directory and run "make install" 
If your cell phone is AARCH64 you should delete the src folder and compile the program. 

This repository hizes it in case you need some lxde stuff or other extra programs. 

Soon I will make deb packages for ARM32 and they will be hosted in :
