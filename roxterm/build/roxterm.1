.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
ROXTerm is a terminal emulator\&. It provides features similar to gnome\-terminal\&. It is based on the same VTE library, which implements a virtual terminal emulator\&.
.PP
The original design goals of ROXTerm were twofold\&. A small memory footprint and a quick start\-up time\&. This was realised by not using the Gnome libraries and by moving the configuration GUI to a separate applet\&. However, thanks to all the features it has acquired over the years, ROXTerm can now be accused of bloat\&. But it is now very configurable indeed\&. It is aimed at "power" users who make heavy use of terminals and who wish to have fine control over the many options\&.
.PP
ROXTerm still supports the ROX desktop application layout it was named after\&. It can also be installed in a conventional manner for use in other desktop environments\&. Both X11 and Wayland are supported\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
ROXTerm follows the usual
GNU
command line syntax\&. Both long options starting with two dashes (`\-\*(Aq) and short single dash options are provided\&. Here follows a summary of options\&.

.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-borderless\fR \fB\-b\fR
.RS 4
Disable window decorations like title bar, resize controls and frame border, if the window manager supports this\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-tab\fR
.RS 4
If possible open the new terminal in an existing window rather than open a new window\&. If used in conjunction with
\fB\-T\fR/\fB\-\-title\fR
the tab will be placed in an existing window with the same title template if one exists\&. This option overrides
\fB\-\-zoom\fR
and
\fB\-\-fullscreen\fR\&.

.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-tab\-name=\fR\fB\fINAME\fR\fR \fB\-n \fR\fB\fINAME\fR\fR
.RS 4
Set tab name as displayed in its label\&. May include "%s" which is substituted with the window title string set by the terminal, "%n" which is substituted by the number of tabs, and "%t" which is substituted by the current tab number\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-separate\fR
.RS 4
Use a separate process for this terminal\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-fork\fR
.RS 4
Always fork into the background\&. Usually the first instance stays in the foreground and subsequent invocations return once they have asked the master instance to handle their command\&. This option causes the master instance to fork itself into the background; the foreground process returns once the master is ready to handle further commands\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-atexit=\fR\fB\fIACTION\fR\fR
.RS 4
What should be done with the tab after the shell command exits\&. Choose one of: close, hold, respawn, ask\&.
.RE

.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-replace\fR
.RS 4
Replace any existing instance as ROXTerm D\-BUS service provider\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-role=\fR\fB\fIROLE\fR\fR
.RS 4
Set the WM_WINDOW_ROLE property on the window\&. This can be used to uniquely identify a window across sessions, or in selecting configuration resources by window managers\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-session=\fR\fB\fISESSION\fR\fR
.RS 4
Restore the named user session\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-display=\fR\fB\fIDISPLAY\fR\fR
.RS 4
The named X server display to use\&. If you use roxterm on multiple different displays on the same system then you need to use the \-\-separate option as well\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-e\fR \fB\-\-execute\fR
.RS 4
Execute remainder of the command line inside the terminal\&. This must be the final option\&. If there is only one following argument, it is parsed in case it is a command with space\-separated arguments that was passed to roxterm in quotes\&. If there is more than one argument they are treated as a command and arguments without parsing\&.
.RE
.SH "SETUP"
.PP
D\-Bus is a messaging system which ROXTerm uses to connect terminals with its configure tool\&. ROXTerm uses the "session" bus, which should be started along with your desktop environment\&. Current versions of ROX, GNOME and KDE/Plasma session managers all launch D\-Bus\&. If you use some other session/desktop/window manager, which doesn\*(Aqt launch D\-Bus, you need to start it yourself\&. Insert something like this near the start of your \&.xinitrc or \&.xsession:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
        if test \-z "$DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS" ; then
            eval `dbus\-launch \-\-sh\-syntax \-\-exit\-with\-session`
            export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS
        fi
    
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
This setup provides a way to map an arbitrary number of profiles onto configuration filenames\&.
.SH "TABS"
.PP
Each window can contain a number of tabs, each with its own terminal\&. The tab bar is always shown by default, even if there is only one tab, to avoid resizing inconsistencies, but this is configurable\&.
.PP
If you experience a problem with tab labels shrinking, after dragging tabs so that they only have room to display \*(Aq\&.\&.\&.\*(Aq, then make sure the pointer is over the body of a terminal when you drop a dragged tab, not over the tab bar area\&.
.SH "MENUS"
.PP
When the menu bar is hidden, the popup menu duplicates the same items as in the menu bar\&. This gives you full access to all the functions with the menu bar hidden\&. The menu bar is effectively redundant, but provided to make ROXTerm appear more straightforward for first\-time users\&. It can be turned on and off for a particular window or more permanently by using the configuration manager\&.
.PP
The popup menu also allows email and web addresses to be opened in external applications, if such an address is highlighted by the pointer being over it\&.
.SH "URI HIGHLIGHTING"
.PP
When the pointer is over an address that ROXTerm recognises as a URI (typically a web URL or email address) it is highlighted by underlining and a change of pointer shape\&. You can open the address either by right\-clicking on it and choosing Open\&.\&.\&. in the menu or by holding Ctrl and left\-clicking\&. The applications used to handle these addresses may be set with the configuration tool, otherwise it will try to find a suitable default\&.
.PP
Also, by holding down the Ctrl key, you can drag a URI to pass it to another application which is willing to accept it as a URI or text\&. Dragging it into the same window it came from pastes the address back in\&.
.PP
If the pointer is over the server address portion of a URL it only highlights the address, but not the filename\&. Move the pointer over the filename to get the whole URL\&. Similarly, you can highlight an email address with or without a leading mailto:\&.
.PP
SSH URI and hostname matching is supported\&. URIs including a path name can only be copied to the clipboard\&. In the absence of a pathname, ROXTerm can also start a ssh session to the described host\&. Plain hostnames are also matched, but only if they start with "ssh", or end with "\&.local" or "\&.lan"\&.
.SH "DRAG AND DROP"
.PP
You can drag items onto terminal windows\&. Text objects are fed to the terminal as if typed\&. Files and URIs have their location fed in rather than the object\*(Aqs contents\&. Graphical files can also be dragged onto the appropriate area of the configuration manager to set terminal background images\&. Hold down the Ctrl key while dragging a highlighted URI, to allow the address to be dragged to another application\&.
.PP
You can now drag tabs by their labels to reorder them within a window or to move them to another ROXTerm window or, by dropping them outside a ROXTerm window, move tabs to new windows of their own\&. Use mouse button 3 (the right button) to move an unselected tab without selecting it\&. Button 2 is a shortcut to paste the contents of the clipboard as the tab\*(Aqs name\&.
.SH "SESSIONS"
.PP
User sessions can be saved under a name\&. Click Save Session\&.\&.\&. in the File menu\&. A session preserves the current state windows and tabs, but not their textual content\&. A session can be restored with the \-\-session option\&. It will be restored by the default if it is named \*(AqDefault\*(Aq\&. Leaving the field blank is equivalent to \*(AqDefault\*(Aq\&.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.PP
Configuration is based on named profiles, so you can save different sets of options and switch between them quickly\&. There are profiles for general options, colour schemes and keyboard shortcuts\&. Colour Schemes and Profiles apply to one tab at a time, but Keyboard Shortcuts apply to all tabs in the same window\&. New windows and tabs inherit settings from the window/tab they were opened from\&.
.PP
The Preferences menu allows you to select the current profile\&. Open the configuration manager to edit the current profile or colour scheme, or to manage all settings\&. In the configuration manager you can select one of the four types of option groups and edit, copy, delete or rename them\&. The item with the selected radio button is the default for new terminals\&.
.SH "KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS"
.PP
ROXTerm allows the keyboard shortcut profiles to be edited in a text editor, either via the Configuration Manager or from a terminal\*(Aqs menu (Preferences submenu)\&. The action names correspond to the localised labels used in the menu items\&. The new shortcuts should automatically be reloaded when you save the file\&. Alternatively, selecting a scheme in the Preferences menu now forces it to be reloaded\&. The default file for keyboard shortcuts is:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
        ~/\&.config/roxterm\&.sourceforge\&.net/Shortcuts/Default\&.
    
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The default keyboard shortcuts are:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

.nf
        Ctrl+Shift+N    New Window
        Ctrl+Shift+T    New Tab
        Ctrl+Shift+Q    Close Window
        Ctrl+Shift+W    Close Tab
        Ctrl+PageUp     Previous Tab
        Ctrl+PageDown   Next Tab

        Ctrl+Shift+F    Find\&.\&.\&.
        Ctrl+Shift+I    Find Next
        Ctrl+Shift+P    Find Previous

.PP
In addition, tabs can be selected by
Alt+1, where 1 is to be replaced by the tab number\&. This can be disabled in the profile\&.
.SH "CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT"
.PP
Run the configuration manager by selecting "Configure\&.\&.\&." in ROXTerm\*(Aqs menu or run
\fBroxterm\-config\fR\&.
.PP
Configuration files can be swapped with other users\&. Each profile, colour scheme and keyboard shortcut scheme consists of a single file\&. Saving a file in the appropriate directory will create a profile with the same name as the file\&.
.PP
Locations for files follow the XDG Base Directory specification\&.

Within any or each of those locations, profiles are saved in a "Profiles" subdirectory, colour schemes in "Colours" and keyboard shortcut schemes in "Shortcuts"\&. A file called "Global" contains miscellaneous options, which don\*(Aqt fall into the above categories, including the default profile for new terminals\&.
.SH "ADVANCED"
.PP
ROXTerm terminals can be configured from applications and scripts via D\-BUS\&. For this purpose there are three methods\&. They require an ID code to target a specific terminal\&. Each roxterm\*(Aqs ID can be read from the environment variable ROXTERM_ID in the shell or application running in it\&. The D\-Bus object path is "net\&.sf\&.roxterm\&.Options" and the D\-Bus interface is "/net/sf/roxterm/Options"\&. The methods are:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
        SetProfile("id", "profile_name")
    
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Ask the terminal to use the named profile\&. Note that any other tabs in the same window will be updated to the same new profile\&. All tabs in one window must have the same profile, so that their font size and terminal size remain consistent\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
        SetColourScheme("id", "scheme_name")
    
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Ask the terminal to use the named colour scheme\&. Tabs sharing the same window may have different colour schemes from each other\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
        SetShortcutScheme("id", "scheme_name")
    
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Ask the terminal to use the named keyboard shortcut scheme\&. Tabs sharing the same window must also share the same shortcut scheme\&.
.PP
Example using dbus\-send in a shell script:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
      dbus\-send \-\-session /net/sf/roxterm/Options \e
           net\&.sf\&.roxterm\&.Options\&.SetColourScheme \e
           string:$ROXTERM_ID string:GTK
    
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
You may also send D\-Bus signals to change individual options within a named profile or colour scheme using the methods StringOption, IntOption (also used for boolean options) and FloatOption\&. All terminals using the named profile or colour scheme are affected, but only temporarily\&. The options are not saved for new terminals\&. The methods all take 3 arguments:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Full profile name, including a prefix of "Profiles/" or "Colours/"
.RE
.sp

.RE
.PP
To see which option names you can use, check the config files, from which the types can be deduced\&. Example using dbus\-send in a shell script:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
        dbus\-send \-\-session /net/sf/roxterm/Options \e
            net\&.sf\&.roxterm\&.Options\&.StringOption \e
            string:Colours/GTK string:background \*(Aqstring:#ffffff\*(Aq
    
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
A third possible use is to notify roxterm that a profile, colour scheme or shortcuts scheme has been changed by an external program and all terminals using that profile etc need to reload it:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
        OptionsChanged("family_name", "profile_name")
    
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
where family_name is one of "Profiles", "Colours" or "Shortcuts"\&. For example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
        dbus\-send \-\-session /net/sf/roxterm/Options \e
            net\&.sf\&.roxterm\&.Options\&.OptionsChanged \e
            string:Profiles string:Default
